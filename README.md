# EEG_autoencoder

In this notebook, I tried to solve a 2-class classification problem using Epilespy EEG data.

The dataset is available from https://zenodo.org/record/3684992

This dataset was generated with a motive to build predictive epilepsy diagnosis models. It was generated on a similar acquisition and settings i.e., sampling frequency, bandpass filtering and number of signals and time duration as its much more famous counterpart - the University of Bonn dataset. It has overcome the limitations faced by the University of Bonn dataset, such as different EEG recording sites (inter-cranial and scalp) for healthy and epileptic patients. All the data were taken exclusively using surface EEG electrodes.
